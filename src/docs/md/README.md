# Overview

Bastion is a library that eases the development of end-to-end tests for HTTP APIs. A typical user would write 
tests using Bastion based off of some sort of API specification. This API specification can be anything like a 
WADL file, RAML file or a JSON schema. A test engineer would prepare requests and responses based on these specifications 
to test the overall process of calling these APIs.

# Usage

## Test

* `GET` Request:

[ex:general-get-example]

* `POST` Request:

[ex:general-post-example]

* JSON Assertion: (property order in response does not affect test)

[ex:simple-json-assertion]

* JSON Request:

[ex:json-request-example]

* JSON Request/Assertion loaded from file:

[ex:load-from-file]

* Form URL Encoded Data Request:

[ex:form-url-encoded-request]

* Bind the response entity to a model object:

[ex:bound-data] 

## Dependency

Use a dependency management tool such as Maven to download the Bastion library for use in your project. Add the following
dependency to your POM file:

```xml
<dependency>

    <artifactId>bastion</artifactId>
    <version>[VERSION]</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
<dependency>
```

Alternatively, use Groovy Grapes to use Bastion in your Groovy tests/scripts:

```groovy
@Grapes(
    @Grab(group='rocks.bastion', module='bastion', version='[VERSION]')
)
```

# Building
