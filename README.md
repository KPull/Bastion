# Overview

Bastion is a Java-based library for quickly creating tests for your HTTP APIs.
You can quickly define the request object to send as well as the expected response. Furthermore, 
Bastion supports keeping state between your different API calls so that you can even create 
fully-automated end-to-end tests for your APIs which contain more than one call (eg. create 
a user then login with *that* user).

# Building

Use Maven to build Bastion and run the associated tests. After checking out the repository 
use the following command to build and test the source code.
